# Algorithms and Problems

Whether you are preparing yourself for interviewing at a big company, a programming contest or just trying to improve your skills, a big part of your time might be spent solving programming problems. 

There are many sites out there providing you with a myriad of problems and their variations to be solved. I'll be picking problems from different sources and will be providing *my* solutions for those problems. 

This repository was created for educational purposes so unless explicitly said, the solutions will focus on readibility and ease of understanding, instead of focusing on the optimal solution (fastest implementation, least use of space).

The solutions will be written mostly in Go as it's been my favorite language for a while now. However it shouldn't be too difficult to understand if you're already familiar with programming. If this is your first time seeing Go, I suggest taking a look at [A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1). If you've just started with programming, take a look at [this great crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU) for beginners by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
